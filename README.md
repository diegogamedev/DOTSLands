# DOTSLands
 
### This is a **DOTS Multiplayer RTS** study project.

Inside this repo is all my work on DOTS/ECS by Unity, this was a project but it got cancelled do to all the uncertainty around the ECS/DOTS future. Inside you can preview some gameplay systems and network implementation using DOTSNET.

Mechanics including (but not limited to):
 Dynamic Selection of characters using selection box
 Not Owned Animation System (my solution for syncing animations p2p based on server state, probably have some better implementations)
 Pathfinding
 Multiplayer
 Claiming terrains (stay on a floating white transparent square long enough so it will be claimed on all clients)
